    authors: "Tsetan Dolker ",
    journal: "JETIR",
    year: 2023,
    abstract:
      "As glaciers start to melt faster, and there is less snowfall and rain due to global warming, farming patterns in Ladakh, India, have been impacted. This action research paper discusses how the ice stupa can address the water scarcity in the region and its potential to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on agriculture. The paper reveals that 90% of surveyed respondents support the building of more ice stupas, suggesting a scalable solution for water conservation.",

      "Ice Stupas Have Become a Popular Water Management Tool in the Himalayas. But Can They Work in Chile?",
    authors: "Pria Mahadevan",
    journal: "GlacierHub - News from the Columbia Climate School",
    year: 2023,
    abstract:
      "Ice stupas, human-made reservoirs that capture glacial meltwater and preserve it in the form of ice, have been used across the Himalayas for decades. These ice stupas are now being explored by Chilean engineers under the Nilus Project as a solution for water management in the Andes. This project aims to transfer the technology from the Himalayas to Chile, with early proof of concept showing success. The article explores this South-to-South knowledge transfer and its implications for water management in high-altitude regions.",

      "Growth and decay of an ice stupa in alpine conditions – a simple model driven by energy-flux observations over a glacier surface",
    authors:
      "Johannes Oerlemans, Suryanarayanan Balasubramanian, Conradin Clavuot, Felix Keller",
    journal: "The Cryosphere",
    year: 2021,
    abstract:
      "This paper presents a simple model to calculate the evolution of an ice stupa (artificial ice reservoir). The model, formulated for a cone geometry, is driven by energy balance measurements over a glacier surface for a 5-year period. The exposure factor is introduced to account for the rough surface of an ice stupa and its increased exposure to wind. The results show that, under typical alpine conditions at 2100 m, an ice stupa may reach a volume of 200 to 400 m³ in early April. The model also helps evaluate the impacts of snow cover, water availability, and environmental factors like wind speed on ice stupa size.",
